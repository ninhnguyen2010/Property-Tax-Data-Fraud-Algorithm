# Property-Tax-Data-Fraud-Algorithm
In this project, we aimed to develop a fraud detection algorithm for property tax data using anomaly detection techniques. The dataset used for this analysis consisted of 1,070,994 records, each representing a property within the city. We performed extensive data cleaning, including removing government-owned properties and imputing missing values. After data cleaning, we created 61 variables to measure the unusualness of property values and sizes. These variables included ratios comparing market value and land value to lot size and building size, as well as grouped averages based on ZIP code and tax class. 

For dimensionality reduction, we applied a technique to reduce the number of variables while preserving the maximum amount of information. Principal Component Analysis (PCA) was used, resulting in 10 principal components that explained over 80% of the data's variance. Two anomaly detection methods were employed: Z-Score Outliers and Autoencoder. Z-Score Outliers measured the distance of each record from the origin using standardized principal components, while Autoencoder assessed the error in reproducing the data. We combined the scores from these algorithms using a weighted average rank order to obtain a final anomaly score for each property. The results of our analysis provide a way to identify potentially fraudulent properties that deviate significantly from expected values. Users can examine properties with the highest anomaly scores and investigate them further. We finally present five interesting case studies showcasing properties with unusual characteristics.
